   <h1>What is Formula One?</h1>
   <p>Formula One, more commonly known as <b>Formula 1</b> or <b>F1</b>, is the highest 
      tier of international racing for open-wheel single seater formula racing cars
      that's under the umbrella covered by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA).
      The FIA covers Formula One, World Rally Championship, World Endurance Championship, World
      Turing Car Cup, World Rallycross Championship, Formula E (an all electric variant of 
      Formula One), and many other froms and lower level tiers of racing. The FIA has been 
      officially fully recognized by the international Olympic Committee in 2013.
   </p>

   <p>Formula One cars are the fastest regulated road-course racing cars in the world, 
      owing to very high cornering speeds achieved through the generation of large 
      amounts of aerodynamic downforce. Much of this downforce is generated by front 
      and rear wings, which have the side effect of causing severe turbulence behind 
      each car (also know as dirty air). The turbulence reduces the downforce generated 
      by the cars following directly behind, making it hard to overtake. Major changes made to 
      the cars for the 2022 season has seen greater use of ground effect aerodynamics and modified 
      wings to reduce the turbulence behind the cars, with the goal of making overtaking easier.<br>
      The FIA Formula One World Championship has been one of the premier forms of racing 
      around the world since its inaugural season in 1950 (<i>fun fact, <b>Ferarri</b> is the only
      team to have raced every since the inaugural season!</i>). The word formula in the name 
      refers to the set of rules to which all participants' cars must conform. A Formula 
      One season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix. 
      Grands Prix take place in multiple countries and continents around the world on 
      either purpose-built circuits or closed public roads.
   </p>
      
   <p>A points system is used at Grands Prix to determine two annual World Championships: 
      one for the <b>drivers</b>, and one for the <b>constructors</b> (the teams). Each 
      driver must hold a valid Super Licence, the highest class of racing licence issued 
      by the FIA, and the races must be held on tracks graded "1", the highest 
      grade-rating issued by the FIA for tracks.
   </p>

   <h4>The Costs of Running a Formula One Team</h4>
   <p>The average annual cost of running a team which includes designing, building, 
      and maintaining cars, pay, transport is approximately <b>£220,000,000 or $265,000,000</b>.
      In 2020, Mercedes AMG Petronas F1 Team placed first in the constructors championship
      and were rewarded with a $135,000,000 payout. This may seem confusing because how could
      even the first placed team ever afford to keep racing when winning the season is just
      about half the operating costs? Well, it comes down to one word: advertisements. The
      better your team places, the more you can charge for the ads teams place on their cars,
      more people will buy merchandise, etc.
