         <h3 class="FAQ">When was the track built?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Constructed in just 110 days in 1922, the Autodromo Nazionale Monza was the world's 
               third purpose-built race track, coming after Brooklands in the UK and Indianapolis 
               in the US. Like those two tracks, the original circuit featured a daunting series of 
               banked curves, as well as much of the 'outfield' section that's still in use today.
            </p>

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Monza opened its doors on September 3 1922, just a week before it hosted that year's 
               Italian Grand Prix. It was then part of the original Formula 1 calendar in 1950, and 
               has held the Italian Grand Prix every year bar one since.
            </p>
         
         <h3 class="FAQ">What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Rapido! Formula 1's fastest ever lap was set at Monza by Williams driver 
               Juan Pablo Montoya's 260.6km/h effort during practice for the 2004 Grand Prix 
               which should give you some idea of the nature of the track the locals call
               'La Pista Magica'. Cars are on full throttle for 80% of the lap, and hit 
               their Vmax on the circuit's 1.1km start/finish straight. From there, they roar 
               off into the historic park section, where a series of big stops into tight 
               chicanes give the brakes a good workout.

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was the track built?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Little did those laying the perimeter road to the RAF Silverstone airfield 
               in 1942 know that they were setting down what would become one of the world's 
               greatest race tracks. But, well, they were! The Silverstone circuit was first 
               used for a proper motor race in 1947 although sadly, a local sheep lost its 
               life during the proceedings…
            </p>

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Silverstone was the first Grand Prix, hosting the inaugural Formula 1 World 
               Championship round on May 13 1950. Old campaigner Giuseppe Farina, who'd 
               take that year's title, won the race in his Alfa Romeo 158.

         <h3 class="FAQ">What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">At the 2018 British Grand Prix, Lewis Hamilton compared a flat-out lap around 
               Silverstone to flying a fighter jet, which should tell you all you need to know 
               about the Northamptonshire circuit. Despite numerous layout changes over the 
               years, Silverstone has always maintained its essential character as one of 
               the fastest tracks on the F1 calendar, while historic corners like Maggotts, 
               Becketts and Abbey provide some of the biggest challenges for racing drivers 
               anywhere in the world.

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was the track built?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">The original, triangle-shaped track was built in 1921, with designers 
               Jules de Thier and Henri Langlois van Ophem using public roads between the 
               towns of Francorchamps, Malmedy, and Stavelot to create an amazing 14.9km 
               circuit taking in the forests and rolling hills of the beautiful Ardennes 
               region. The track was redeveloped in 1979, and although the new circuit is 
               only half the original's length, it's still the longest on the current calendar 
               at 7.004km.
            </p>

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Having hosted a non-championship Grand Prix as long ago as 1924, Belgium's iconic 
               circuit was one of just seven to be part of Formula 1's maiden championship in 1950. 
               That race was won by the legendary Juan Manuel Fangio, who led home an Alfa Romeo 
               one-two ahead of team mate Nino Farina.
            </p>
         
         <h3 class="FAQ">What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Spa is among Formula 1 drivers' most loved tracks, with its mix of long straights 
               and challenging fast corners allowing them to push their cars to the edge of their 
               capabilities if it's dry, that is. The size of the track and the nature of Belgian 
               weather means it can sometimes be raining on one part of the track and dry on another, 
               meaning grip can vary from one corner to the next. Keep an eye on the thrilling Eau 
               Rouge, arguably the most famous sequence of corners in the world, as the drivers flick 
               left, right and then up the hill through Raidillon.

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was the track built?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">In 1962. Soichiro Honda, whose car company you may have heard of, was a man with 
               big ambitions. Seeking to turn Honda into an automotive powerhouse, he decided 
               his company should have its own test track. Dutchman John Hugenholtz got the nod, 
               and drew up the now-iconic 'crossover' Suzuka track although original drawings 
               saw the track pass over and under itself a full three times, which would have been sweet!
            </p>

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Despite most people agreeing that Suzuka is a worthy successor to sliced bread 
               in the 'Best Thing' stakes, the Japanese track was a relative latecomer to the 
               F1 calendar, making its first appearance in 1987. Nigel Mansell would remember 
               that weekend well, after he suffered a crash in qualifying that ruled him out 
               of the race, gifting that year's championship to his bitter rival Nelson Piquet.
            </p>
         
         <h3 class="FAQ">What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Show us a racing a driver who doesn't love Suzuka, and we'll show you a liar. 
               The high-speed track remains one of the ultimate driving challenges, with the 
               snaking 'S' Curves, the two commitment-rewarding Degners and the white-knuckle 
               ride of 130R all highlights in a series of highlights at what is one of F1's 
               seminal tracks. And hey, it's got a crossover, which is always cool, right?

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was the track built?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">In 1215, sort of - that's when Monaco was first established as a colony of Genoa.
            </p>

         <h3 class="FAQ">When was its first Grand Prix?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">It was 1929 when racing engines first reverberated around the Principality, 
               after cigarette manufacturer Antony Noghes decided to organise a race with his 
               pals from the Automobile Club de Monaco. The race was part of the calendar in 
               the first year of the Formula 1 World Championship in 1950, and hasn't been off 
               it since 1955.
            </p>
         
         <h3 class="FAQ">What's the circuit like?</h3>
            <p class="FAQanswer">Incredibly narrow and totally iconic. Nelson Piquet memorably described driving 
               around Monaco as “like riding a bicycle around your living room”… which is fair. 
               Despite that, it's a challenge that nearly all drivers love, forcing them to put 
               their skills on the line and rewarding millimetric accuracy. Overtaking on the 
               tight streets is harder, however, with the 2003 Grand Prix witnessing a grand total 
               of zero passing moves!
